# MindMate Chatbot

**An AI-powered chatbot for daily mental wellness check-ins and personalized mindfulness exercises — built with Next.js.**

MindMate helps users build healthier daily habits through short conversational check-ins, adaptive mindfulness exercises, mood journaling, and data-backed insights. This repository contains the web frontend, backend API, and AI integration skeleton for a hackathon-ready MVP (≈90% of planned features).

## 💚 Problem Statement

Many people live with daily stress, anxiety, and burnout but lack a low-friction, affordable, and stigma-free way to check in with their mental health. Existing tools are often generic, hard to maintain, or expensive. MindMate provides gentle, science-backed daily check-ins and personalized mindfulness exercises so users can cultivate consistent self-care and spot patterns before issues escalate.

## 🏆 Project Overview

MindMate is a compassionate, AI-driven companion that:
- Checks in with users conversationally each day,
- Provides short, adaptive mindfulness exercises (breathing, grounding, micro-meditations),
- Tracks mood and journal entries over time,
- Generates simple insights and nudges based on user history,
- Prioritizes privacy, safety, and clear escalation flows for crisis situations.

This project was built for hackathon delivery with a pragmatic, demo-focused architecture using Next.js for rapid iteration and an extensible AI orchestration layer.
